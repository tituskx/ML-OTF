This repository contains the code that can be used to reproduce the 2D results from the master thesis: [DeepONet Generated Optimal Test Functions for the Finite Element Method](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:0051e66b-2a12-4b74-bf5d-2f1b486651cd). The 2D results will be expanded and published in the near future.
